# Life Path Test (Streamlit MVP)

Life Path Test is a small Streamlit-based web application designed as a learning-focused MVP rather than a finished or validated product.

The project explores how a simple, interactive questionnaire can be structured, presented to users, and iterated over time using collected interaction data.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is not to provide accurate personality analysis or scientific results.

Instead, it focuses on:
- Building a complete but small-scale product
- Understanding user flow from start to finish
- Practicing how data can inform iteration decisions
- Learning how to move from a static idea to an evolving product

This project is intentionally scoped to remain simple and flexible.

## How It Works

- Questions are loaded dynamically from JSON files
- Users answer a sequence of questions through a Streamlit interface
- Responses are processed using basic scoring logic
- A result profile is generated at the end of the session
- Anonymous interaction data is stored for later analysis

The structure allows questions and logic to be adjusted without changing the core application code.

## Current Features

- JSON-driven question system
- Session-based questionnaire flow
- Basic scoring and result generation
- Lightweight data logging (JSONL)

---

## Current Limitations

- No scientific or psychological validation
- Minimal error handling
- Limited analytics and visualization
- Simple UI focused on functionality over design

These limitations are intentional and aligned with the project’s learning-first approach.

## v2 Roadmap (In Progress)

The next iteration focuses on moving from interaction to insight:

- Session-level event logging
- Structured data storage (SQLite)
- Basic admin analytics page
- Question-level drop-off analysis
- Result distribution overview
- Share link click tracking

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- JSON / JSONL
- SQLite (planned)

---

## Status

Active – under continuous iteration as part of a broader AI product development learning process.
